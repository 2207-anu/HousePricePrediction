--------------------House Price Prediction using Machine Learning------------------
                         Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using a Linear Regression machine learning model.
The model is trained on a housing dataset containing features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and other amenities.

The goal of this project is to:

Understand the dataset
Clean and preprocess the data
Train a Linear Regression model
Evaluate the model using RMSE and R² score
Interpret feature coefficients
Save the trained model
